		 		<p>Nature is the creation of natural material and physical world on earth independent of
					the human activities. The beauty and richness of nature is diverse and massive.
					Nature provides us with several delicacies to enjoy and is our life support system.
					Our basic needs like food, shelter, water and air are all the gifts from nature.
					Humans have a strong connection and interrelation with nature.<br>
					Escaping away in the nature heals the mind and body and soothes our soul.
					Irrespective of what nature provides us it is also our moral and social responsibility to nurture nature.
					You will find below a number of short and long paragraphs on Nature.<br>
					We hope these Nature paragraphs will help students in completing their school assignments.
					These will also help children to write and read out paragraphs with simple words and small sentences.
					Students can select any paragraph on Nature according to their particular requirement.
					Nature is that natural and physical world that surrounds us and makes life possible on earth.
					Nature is the heart of earth. Nature heals us and helps build connection with our freedom,
					authenticity and our souls. Simply connecting and feeling nature gives us a divine pleasure.
					We have a strong bond and emotional connection with nature.<br>
					The serenity of nature calms our hearts. The stillness and movement in nature both have a hypnotizing effect.
					The unfolding creativity of nature is an art. It is alluring to experience solitude with nature.

					Everyone loves to escape away in the mysteries of nature.</p>
